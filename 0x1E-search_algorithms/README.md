# Search Algorithms

| Questions | Answers |
| ---- | ---- |
| What is a search algorithm | a search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem. It's a method or a set of rules that are used to find a specific item or information within a collection of data. |
| What is a linear search | linear search is a method for finding an element within a list |
| What is a binary search | binary search is a more efficient search algorithm, especially for sorted collections. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target item is found or the search interval becomes empty. |
